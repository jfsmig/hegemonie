# Hegemonie

Hegemonie is an online management, strategy and diplomacy RPG. The current
initiative is a reboot of what [hegemonie.be](http://www.hegemonie.be) was
between 1999 and 2003. It is under "heavily inactive" construction. Learn more
details about the [gameplay](./GAME.md) on the dedicated page.

## How To Contribute

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place. Any
contributions you make are greatly appreciated.

1. Fork the Project
   
2. Create your Feature Branch (git checkout -b feature/MyFeature)
   
3. Commit your Changes (git commit -m 'Add some MyFeature')
   
4. Push to the Branch (git push origin feature/MyFeature)
   
5. Open a Pull Request... and if it takes to long to get a feedback, that's
   probably because the maintainers didn't notice it. Do not hesitate to pig
   them :).

## License

Hegemonie is distributed under the MPLv2 License, see the [LICENSE](./LICENSE)
disclaimer for more information. We strongly believe in Open Source for many
reasons:

* For quality purposes, and a better user experience. Because bugs will happen
  and opening the code is the best way to let a skilled user find it as soon as
  possible. The value of a game instance definitely is in its players and in the
  description of the world.
  
* For transparency purposes, so that there is no doubt that anything odd is done
  with your data while running a game.
  
* For an easy adoption, we deliberately chose a liberal license so that there
  cannot be any legal concern in using the code, commercially or not. We would
  appreciate you upstream your changes to the code, but you should not be forced
  to. It is already an honor to have a use case.
  
* Because any participant to the project deserves anyone to know it.
